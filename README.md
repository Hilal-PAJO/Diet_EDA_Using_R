📖INTRODUCTION
This study aims to understand the effects of individuals' stress level, sleep quality, age, gender and other factors on weight change. 
The aim of this analysis is to create a model that can predict weight change. For this purpose, answers were sought to questions such as:
#What are the relationship among provided factors and visualization of results?
#What are the variables that best explain weight change?
#Is there a regression model that can predict weight change?

🏥This analysis can be beneficial for health professionals, nutritionists, and individuals seeking to understand the key factors influencing weight change and develop more personalized health and wellness strategies.

💻This project was conducted to showcase my data analysis skills, and while the insights are valuable, the findings could be further strengthened with a larger sample size. Additionally, the analysis could be expanded with alternative perspectives and methods, reflecting the dynamic nature of data analysis.


🔗DATA SOURCE AND METHODOLOGY
Source of this dataset is:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdullah0a/comprehensive-weight-change-prediction/data
The dataset includes variables such as stress, sleep, age, gender, calorie consumption and basal metabolic rate of individuals(100 raws and 14 columns). 
In this study, data cleaning, exploratory analysis, regression analysis and hypothesis testing were performed using R.

ABOUT THIS FILE
📌Participant ID: Unique identifier for each participant in the study.
📌Age: The age of the participant (in years), which can influence metabolism and weight change.
📌Gender: Gender of the participant (M/F), as physiological differences may affect weight management.
📌Current Weight (lbs): The participant's weight at the beginning of the study, serving as a baseline for weight change.
📌BMR (Calories): Basal Metabolic Rate, calculated using the Mifflin-St Jeor equation, representing the number of calories burned at rest.
📌Daily Calories Consumed: Total caloric intake per day, including variability to reflect real-world eating habits.
📌Daily Caloric Surplus/Deficit: The difference between calories consumed and BMR, indicating whether the participant is in a caloric surplus or deficit.
📌Weight Change (lbs): The estimated change in weight over a specified duration, based on caloric surplus/deficit.
📌Duration (weeks): The time period over which weight change is measured, ranging from 1 to 12 weeks.
📌Physical Activity Level: Self-reported level of physical activity, categorized as Sedentary, Lightly Active, Moderately Active, or Very Active.
📌Sleep Quality: Self-reported quality of sleep, categorized as Poor, Fair, Good, or Excellent, which can affect weight management.
📌Stress Level: A numerical score (1-10) indicating the participant's perceived stress level, as stress can influence eating behaviors and weight.
